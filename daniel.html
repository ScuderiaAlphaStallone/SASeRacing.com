    <h2>Daniel Chahar</h2>
    <p>Chief Strategist - Head of Strategy Drafting for Both Cars.</p>
    <p>
      Daniel Started out with us just as an Intern on our debut Pro season, but has been the reason for
      us crossing our very first race proving us why hes an asset worth having at our team at any chance.
      His very first strategy draft came out as a heavy gamble but was super clinical at the race's end, giving us the
      tyre life edge. He has been the 'Main Man' for us at Spa 6 Hours and Sebring 12 Hours. He currently manages both our Cars' primary
      strategies, giving us autonomy on utilizing the grays of the off track action.
