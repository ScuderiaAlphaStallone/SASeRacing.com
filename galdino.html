    <h2>Anderson Galdio</h2>
    <p>Second Driver - 24h of LeMans iR R4 Winner. Car Number 7.</p>
    <p>
      Andy is our Team's Reserve driver, he has completed Road Series and is currently competing in iRacing eNascar 2025 series
      starting this 2025 Season 4. He has finished on podium in 7 out his 15 RS outings. He is a
      Serius prospect for the team given his Controlled Attacking approach and calculated racecraft mid racing all while having raced less than
       150 Races under his Licence, he is naturally fast and has the potential for big Finishes. His 1 Lap pace beyond amazing hinting at his 4 Poles
      in his current Series. He has room for tremendous growth in near future with and for our Team.
